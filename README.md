Based on Christian Buchner's &amp; Christian H.'s CUDA project and tpruvot@github.

Requirements
----------------------------------------

MTP-TCR requires 4.4Gb of vram, hence cards with less than 4.5Gb of vram won't work.
The program uses also around 500Mb and 4.4xCard Number of swap/virtual memory


Building on windows
-------------------

Required: msvc2015 and cuda 9.2 or higher (cuda 10.1 prefered)
Dependencies for windows are included in compat directory, using a different version of msvc will most likely require to recompile those libraries.

In order to build ccminer, choose "Release" and "x64" (this version won't work with win32)
Then click "generate"

Building on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)
------------------------------------------
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
$ sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ build-essential automake linux-headers-$(uname -r) git gawk libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev xorg libc++-dev libgmp-dev python-dev
```
* Note: Installing CUDA 10.1 and compatible drivers from nvidia website and not from ubuntu package is usually easier
2. Compile ccminner:
```bash
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ ./make # add -j to compile faster
```

Running ccminer
----------------------------------------

### Official TecraCoin pool (_recommended_):
1. You don't need to run a wallet to mine with our pool, just start a miner with your TCR address for rewards:

```bash
ccminer -a mtp-tcr -o stratum+tcp://pool.tecracoin.io:4553 -u YOUR_TCR_ADDRESS.worker   -p 0,strict,verbose,d=500 -i 20
```

### Solo mining:
_We don't recommend running miner solo_
1. Run your TecraCoin wallet locally with `server=1` and RPC credentials(`rpcuser`,`rpcpassword`).
2. Start miner:
```bash
ccminer -a mtp16 -o  http://127.0.0.1:rpcport  -u rpcuser -p rpcpassword --coinbase-addr tecracoin-address  -d listofcards  --no-getwork
```

About source code dependencies for windows
------------------------------------------

This project requires some libraries to be built :

- OpenSSL (prebuilt for win)

- Curl (prebuilt for win)

- pthreads (prebuilt for win)

The tree now contains recent prebuilt openssl and curl .lib for both x86 and x64 platforms (windows).

To rebuild them, you need to clone this repository and its submodules :
    git clone https://github.com/peters/curl-for-windows.git compat/curl-for-windows
